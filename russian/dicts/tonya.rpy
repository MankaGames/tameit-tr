Surely there must have been someone living on the other side of the island. It might have been the local natives, but perhaps her passenger, Lee, had managed to escape and ended up here, too. Tonya pushed these thoughts away, she saw that Lee's parachute had not deployed and that he had fallen into the ocean. She didn't want to indulge in futile hopes, but still, she felt terribly lonely, so she just wanted to believe that she was not alone here.\n\nLoneliness weighed on Tonya more than all other circumstances. She could get used to everything, but not this. She wanted to create at least the illusion of someone else's presence, and then she got an idea.\n\nFirst, she made a little man out of coconuts and sticks, drew him eyes and mouth with charcoal, it was funny and for a few days Tonya was satisfied with the result. But that little man looked like a toy, and she wanted something more... something bigger this time.\n\nTonya gathered bamboo, made more ropes, and enthusiastically got to work. It took her a few days, but she was satisfied. A human-sized bamboo doll sprawled on the beach next to Tonya's house in a relaxed pose. She looked at it with a smile and decided to add the finishing touch. Giggling, Tonya admired what she got: it was clearly a man now, a decent-sized bamboo dick perkily and invitingly jutting out between his legs.\n\nSitting down in front of him, Tonya once again looked at the doll and, smiling slyly, thought:  \"Why not?\" She hadn't pleasured herself in a long time and the tension of the last few days was taking its toll. Tonya looked around, bananas were growing quite close by, she plucked one and sat opposite her doll, leaning her back against the palm tree.\n\nInserting the banana into herself, Tonya tilted her head back and imagined that a handsome man was in front of her, passionately and greedily watching her every action, thrusting his cock, getting more and more excited by the sight of her giving herself pleasure. The fantasy overwhelmed Tonya, the banana going deep inside her, going in almost completely. The beach was filled with her loud, unrestrained moans.\n\nAn orgasm rolled over Tonya's body like a wave, she trembled, her toes clenched, burrowing into the warm sand. Exhaling longingly, she took out the banana slippery with her own juices and took a bite of it. With a satisfied smile, she looked at her bamboo \"lover\" and said hoarsely: \"Not bad, buddy\"."

Once she had built a more or less durable house and took care of other important things, Tonya continued to explore the part of the island available to her. She managed to roughly remember the outlines of the island before she jumped out with a parachute, and she knew that the beach and a part of the forest were not the whole island. However, no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't move deeper into the island, because the path was blocked by a deep, steep ravine and mountains on both sides. In addition, the jaguar that she drove away from her house, settled on the hill just in front of the ravine, and there was no way to build a bridge and somehow get over to the other side.

However, Tonya still managed to sneak past the predator a few times and saw the smoke of a bonfire in the distance and some wreckage that seemed to be the remains of a fallen plane in the foliage between the trees. Surely there must have been someone living on the other side of the island. It might have been the local natives, but perhaps her passenger, Lee, had managed to escape and ended up here, too.
